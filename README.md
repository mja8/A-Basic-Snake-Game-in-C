# A-Basic-Snake-Game-in-C
This is a simple console-based snake game written in C programming language. The game follows the classic rules of the snake game, where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food and growing in size. The goal of the game is to eat as much food as possible and avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.
